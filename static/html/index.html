    <p class="text" align="justify"> and this is my first big project. As a little kid I spend a lot of time in front of my computer. Just like everyone else I played videogames: <i>Ravenfield</i>, <i>Hillclimb Racing</i>,
    <i>Star Wars Battlefront 2005</i>, great time!. But as I got older less games, I enjoyed fewer and fewer code. I switched from Steam, Origin and Co. to YouTube, just watching videos all day long. 
    Someday, i saw this classic picture of some nerdy guy, sitting in his dark room, starring at dozens lines of code. Well, this looks damn cool, I need to try this out. So I started ...
    with HTML and CSS, Java in school but nothing really catched my interest. All was to theoretical and boring without any practical use. 
    <b>But this is about to change ... </b>
