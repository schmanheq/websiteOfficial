<h2>childhood</h2>
<p>
    Growing up, I had a pretty rough childhood. My father left before I was even born, I had no brothers or sisters, so just me and my mother. 
    Around 2010, my mum started suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. At the beginning, it wasn't that serious. But as the years went on, her illness reached one extreme phase after another. 
    She started hallucinating, seeing things that weren't there. She had paranoia and a voice in her brain telling her different things, from leaving Germany and going back to Vietnam to killing me and herself. 

    Unfortunately, I wasn't able to escape her dark thoughts or feelings. It started small: coming home after school immediatly, not going to friends birthday parties and so on. Isolation. <br>
    But it got harder. At an age of 8, I was drilled to learn hard. But my mother had a very different concept of "learning hard" than most of you. 
    After I got home from school, I had to study books by memorizing the content. Every day, I sat from around 2 or 3 pm till 9 pm. There was a small break for dinner at 6 pm, but that was a normal school day for me, for 6 days a week. 
    Sometimes, my mother would even controll if I had memorized the content. 2017/18 were the hardest year ever, I was literally trapped in my own room. 
    There were strict times on when I was allowed to leave my room, there were even times on when I was allowed to use the bathroom. The outside area was forbidden for me, as well as meeting friends or other family members.
